/*
With this assignment you will find to folders with multiple .txt-files. These contain files named 
“part_x_y_name.txt” these are 30x30 character parts of ASCII-drawings. That is, the asci-art is 
split into 30 by 30 squares of characters, and need to be puzzled together. After each line you 
will need to add a newline character.

 

Make a C-program that reads and merges these prats into one file where the image looks right.

 

Reading and merging should happen in a c-file separate from the main function. The main function should 
parse parameters and call the separate merging system.
